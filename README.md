# 🧓 Grandmamad

**Grandmamad** is a 3D Unity game where you race to safety as a stylish Israeli grandmother. Collect comfort items and rush to the *Mamad* (shelter) before stress takes over!

This game was created during **JamMamad 2025**, a 30-hour online game jam held on June 20–21, 2025.

The jam's theme was **“Safe Zone”**, inviting participants to explore what safety means — a place, a feeling, or a concept — and express it through gameplay.
